      - "*.rb"
      - "*.yml"
    actions:
      - command: "echo 'Ruby/YAML file changed: {{file_name}}' >> ./logs/changes.log"

    patterns:
      - "*.md"
      - "*.txt"
    actions:
      - command: "echo 'Documentation updated: {{file_path}}'"

    recursive: false
    patterns:
      - "*.yml"

    patterns:
      - "*.log"
    actions:
      - command: "if [ $(stat -c%s {{file_path}}) -gt 1048576 ]; then gzip {{file_path}}; fi"

# Each action is a shell command that will be executed when files change

# Available variables for substitution:
# - {{file_path}}: Full path to the changed file
# - {{file_dir}}: Directory containing the file
# - {{file_name}}: Name of the file (including extension)
# - {{file_base}}: Name of the file without extension
